# Chatbot

This repository is for the Chatbot project.

## Getting started


## Development (TypeScript + Vite)

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- The frontend is implemented with React + TypeScript and Vite. It uses dummy bot responses client-side.
- If you want me to run the dev server here and verify, tell me and I will start it.
